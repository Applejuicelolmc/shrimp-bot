## About Shrimp

This is a work in progress personal discord bot that I started as a little side project. Invitation link will be provided once I'm satisfied with how far this bot has become

Coming soon, somewhere in the future‚Ñ¢

## Locally hosting this bot on your computer

### Requirements

- A system running linux (windows coming soon once I figure out how to make os specific startup scripts :P)
- NodeJS 16.9.0 or greater
- Either a local Mongodb database or a Mongodb Atlas database

### Starting your bot with docker compose

This is a very basic implementation of docker, so currently you cannot update to the latest version with docker, yet ;)

1. Make sure the latest version of docker is installed
2. Clone this repository to your computer/server
3. rename the `example.env` file you can find in the root of this project to `main.env`
4. Edit your new `main.env` file and add the neccesary tokens/id's described in it
5. Start the bot by running `sudo docker compose up -d`

### Preparation and starting your bot locally

1. Clone this repository to your computer/server
2. In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you stored this repository and run `npm install`
3. rename the `example.env` file you can find in the root of this project to `main.env`
4. Edit your new `main.env` file and add the neccesary tokens/id's described in it
5. Start your bot by running `npm start`
6. Removed some existing commands? Run `npm run reset` to reset the existing commands on all servers before adding the new commands
