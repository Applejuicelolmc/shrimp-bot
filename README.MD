### Starting your bot with portainer

</summary>

Disclaimer: my current dockerhub image: `applejuicelolmc/shrimp-bot:yippee` is private and usually not up to date, so cannot be accessed for now, I'm still working out some CI/CD stuff so this can be made public, for now run the bot with via [Docker Compose](#starting-your-bot-locally-with-docker-compose) or [Locally](#running-your-bot-with-npm)

1. Make sure you have a working portainer setup
2. Clone this repository or copy the `example.env` to the computer you use to access portainer
3. Rename the `example.env` to `main.env`
4. Edit your new `main.env` file and add the neccesary tokens/id's described in it
5. In portainer: add a new container from dockerhub with this specific image: `applejuicelolmc/shrimp-bot:yippee`
6. Go the advanced container settings and there click on the `env` tab, there you can upload the `main.env` file
7. That's it now you should be able to deploy the container if all env variables are correct
