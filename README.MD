### Deployment methods

<summary>

#### Starting your bot with portainer

</summary>

1. Make sure you have a working portainer setup
2. Copy the `example.env` to the computer you use to access portainer and rename it to `main.env`
3. Edit your new `main.env` file and add the neccesary tokens/id's described in it
4. In portainer: add a new container from dockerhub with this specific image: `applejuicelolmc/shrimp-bot:latest`
5. Go the advanced container settings and there: click on the `env` tab, there you can upload the `main.env` file
6. That's it now you should be able to deploy the container if all env variables are correct
